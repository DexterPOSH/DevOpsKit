      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",
